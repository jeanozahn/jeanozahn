### Glad to see you here! &nbsp;

üéì I am Jean Zahn, currently holding the position of Squad Leader at Diletta Solutions in Campinas, S√£o Paulo. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Institute of Computing, Federal Fluminense University (IC/UFF), with a focus on Software Engineering and Electronic Government.

üîç My doctoral research focuses on developing a conceptual framework for implementing Citizen-Sourcing in Municipal Ombudsman Offices. In my master's degree, I concentrated on resolving normative conflicts in Multi-Agent Systems, where I developed a mechanism for formally verifying conflicts in Java, considering domain-specific applications derived from OWL ontologies.

üë®‚Äçüíª In my current role, I work with Software Development Teams, utilizing agile methodologies, active communication, and leadership to deliver high-quality software. I prioritize the well-being of developers, recognizing their pivotal role in project success. Although I now oversee personnel, products, and clients, I remain passionate about programming and cherish my roots in software development. You can always count on my expertise and dedication.

### Project and team management: my commitment &nbsp;

As a software engineer, I thrive on collaboration and teamwork, reveling in the dynamic interplay of minds working towards a common goal. I embrace the Scrum framework when it fits the project's needs, fostering an environment of agility and adaptability. But beyond just managing tasks and timelines, my true passion lies in nurturing the growth and development of the individuals on my team.

I see myself not only as a leader but also as a mentor, guiding and empowering my fellow developers to reach greater heights in their careers. I believe that by investing in their professional growth and providing them with the support and resources they need, we can collectively achieve extraordinary results.

In my role, I strive to create a culture of continuous learning and improvement, where every team member feels valued, challenged, and inspired to push their boundaries. Together, we not only deliver exceptional software solutions but also cultivate an environment where innovation thrives and individual talents shine.
