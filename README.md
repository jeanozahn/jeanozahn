### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![

üéì I am Jean Zahn, currently holding the position of Squad Leader at Diletta Solutions in Campinas, S√£o Paulo. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Institute of Computing, Federal Fluminense University (IC/UFF), with a focus on Software Engineering and Electronic Government.

üîç My doctoral research focuses on developing a conceptual framework for implementing Citizen-Sourcing in Municipal Ombudsman Offices. In my master's degree, I concentrated on resolving normative conflicts in Multi-Agent Systems, where I developed a mechanism for formally verifying conflicts in Java, considering domain-specific applications derived from OWL ontologies.

üë®‚Äçüíª In my current role, I work with Software Development Teams, utilizing agile methodologies, active communication, and leadership to deliver high-quality software. I prioritize the well-being of developers, recognizing their pivotal role in project success. Although I now oversee personnel, products, and clients, I remain passionate about programming and cherish my roots in software development. You can always count on my expertise and dedication.
